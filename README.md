## Getting Started

Here is the code you will need to get started with discord-player. Then, you will be able to use `client.player` everywhere in your code!

```js
const Discord = require("discord.js"),
client = new Discord.Client,
settings = {
    prefix: "!",
    token: "Your Discord Token"
};

const { Player } = require("discord-player");

// Create a new Player (you don't need any API Key)
const player = new Player(client);

// To easily access the player
client.player = player;

// add the trackStart event so when a song will be played this message will be sent
client.player.on("trackStart", (message, track) => message.channel.send(`Now playing ${track.title}...`))

client.once("ready", () => {
    console.log("I'm ready !");
});

client.on("message", async (message) => {

    const args = message.content.slice(settings.prefix.length).trim().split(/ +/g);
    const command = args.shift().toLowerCase();

    // !play Despacito
    // will play "Despacito" in the voice channel
    if(command === "play"){
        client.player.play(message, args[0]);
        // as we registered the event above, no need to send a success message here
    }

});

client.login(settings.token);
```

# Other Examples
## Using Cookies

```js
const player = new Player(client, {
    ytdlDownloadOptions: {
        requestOptions: {
            headers: {
                cookie: "YOUR_YOUTUBE_COOKIE"
            }
        }
    }
});
```

## Using Proxy

```js
const HttpsProxyAgent = require("https-proxy-agent");

// Remove "user:pass@" if you don't need to authenticate to your proxy.
const proxy = "http://user:pass@111.111.111.111:8080";
const agent = HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);

const player = new Player(client, {
    ytdlDownloadOptions: {
        requestOptions: { agent }
    }
});
```

# Sources supported
> By default, **discord-player** supports `youtube`, `spotify`, `soundcloud`, `vimeo`, `reverbnation`, `facebook` and `attachment links` only.

**Discord Player** provides **extractor API** that enables you to use your custom stream extractor with it. For example, you can use **youtube-dl** with **discord-player** like this:

```js
const { Downloader } = require("@discord-player/downloader"); // YouTubeDL instance

player.use("EXAMPLE", Downloader); // now discord-player supports 700+ sites :poggies:
```

or you can build your own :D
